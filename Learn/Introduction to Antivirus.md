# [Introduction to Antivirus](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoav)

Checks for current and newly installed files in real time (background)
- Traditional: patterns or signatures in files and removing them
- EDR provides protection based on behavioral analytics in not only files but in memory, network connections, registry, processes

McAfee was first- made to "remove a virus named "Brain" that infected John McAfee's computer"

AV software called scanners and look for viruses in both traditional and new ways
 ## Features
 
- Uncompressing/unarchiving ability as some malware may try to hide in an archived file.
- Unpacker: process of restoring or decrypting the compressed executable files to the original. 
- Emulator:  analyzes malware in a safe and isolated environment

Static: database of signatures

EICAR: contains ASCII strings instead of real malware 

Because of obfuscation techniques, heuristic and behavioral detection have become essential in today's modern AV products
